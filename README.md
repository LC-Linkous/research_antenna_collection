These antennas are modified oval patch antennas on FR4 with permittivity of ~4.4. They are designed to operate at two independent and tunable frequencies. 

**General design summary:**
* Probe-fed design with full copper ground plane
* The two frequencies are independently tunable
    * One frequency is from cheek-to-cheek
    * The second frequency is from head-to-chin
* Little preference is shown in simulation for which orientation is the lower frequency
* Variation in solder 'calico spots' do not impact the design
* Design is impacted more by the probe location in relation to the left ear
* The dual frequencies are better balanced on a round ground plane (not unexpected)
    * Hand cut and milled board outlines measured similarly
